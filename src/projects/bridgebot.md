### About The Project

A short prototype made for the ZostanWDomuRobGry Game Jam in 2020. It combines top-down shooter mechanics with tower defense elements to create a unique and innovative gameplay style. The game was created in 7 days during the Game Jam, and then updated a month later to fix some bugs. After one patch, we decided to pursue other projects.

### Tools Used

Unity (C#), Trello, Notion, Google Docs, Git

### Impact On Project

Designing the core concept, planning out gameplay mechanics, creating characters, fixing bugs/glitches, improving the codebase, writing code.
