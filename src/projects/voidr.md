### About The Project

A bullet-hell space shooter, focused on difficulty and atmosphere. One of my first fully finished projects, it was a big challenge, and I learned a lot while making it. I had many people give me feedback on various mechanics and concepts I experimented with. The game was created in Clickteam Fusion 2.5 and it was a game design learning experience first and foremost.

### Tools Used

Clickteam Fusion 2.5, Trello, Google Docs, Adobe Photoshop

### Impact On Project

Designing the game, creating visual assets, writing the story.
