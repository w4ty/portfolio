### About The Project

I started work on this project to get more familiar with Unity, C# and the process of porting games to various platforms. I managed to get the game running on a PSVita at native resolution (544p) in 60FPS with a working save and load system, though it meant cutting down on the bloom postprocessing effect and some other, smaller optimizations. Since this game was mostly used by me to learn and experiment, I had issues with deciding on a direction to take it in. As of now, it's on an indefinite hold, because of lack of direction and a way too amibitous scale (full quest system, character progression, inventory system with random post-mission drops, multiplatform support, semi-open world, and more).

### Tools Used

Unity (C#), Trello, Google Docs, Excel, Adobe Photoshop, Git

### Impact On Project

Writing most of the code alone and with the use of tutorials, making almost all of the original assets (except for the soundtrack), porting the game to PSVita.
